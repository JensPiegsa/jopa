- Add a LRU cache
- Revisit the way objects and clones are cached in UoW, CloneBuilder and RepositoryMap
    - There should be some unambiguous workflow
    - And how they are loaded, especially as attributes of other objects
- When an entity is persisted and added into the cache, should also entities referenced by it be added into cache (when cascade is used)?
- Add support for parameters in queries (query builder)
- Add support for EntityManager.getReference
- Add support for namespace definition - on class and package level
- Design a strategy for supporting bidirectional relationships. Will probably require modifications of the OntoDriver API
- Do some research on how to implement class hierarchies in JOPA
- Define schema for persistence.xml for JOPA
- Revisit entity classes discovery
- Consider adding support for JNDI data source lookup
- Research whether we could replace aspectj with cglib-generated proxies
