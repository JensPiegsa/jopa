- Add support for ASK queries!!!
- Add support for a 'required' parameter in Object, Data and Annotation Property annotations

- When an entity is removed, there should be some IC check that verifies it is not referenced from any other entity
- Revisit the way objects and clones are cached in UoW, CloneBuilder and RepositoryMap
    - There should be some unambiguous workflow
    - And how they are loaded, especially as attributes of other objects
- Add support for parameters in queries (query builder)
- Add support for EntityManager.getReference
- Add support for namespace definition - on class and package level
- Design a strategy for supporting bidirectional relationships. Will probably require modifications of the OntoDriver API
- Do some research on how to implement class hierarchies in JOPA
- Define schema for persistence.xml for JOPA
- Revisit entity classes discovery
- Consider adding support for JNDI data source lookup
- Research whether we could replace aspectj with cglib-generated proxies
