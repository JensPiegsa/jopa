# JOPA - Java OWL Persistence API

JOPA is a Java OWL persistence API aimed at efficient programatic access to OWL2 ontologies in Java. The system is based
on integrity constraints [1] in OWL that JOPA uses to establish the contract between a JOPA-enabled Java application and
an OWL ontology. he system architecture is similar to JPA 2.1, see [2].

Main features:

* Object-ontological mapping based on integrity constraints,
* Explicit access to inferred knowledge,
* Access to unmapped properties and individual's types
* Transactions
* Separate storage access layer

## Modules

The whole framework consists of several modules:

* JOPA API - definition of the JOPA API, similar to JPA
* OntoDriver API - API of the storage access layer
* JOPA Implementation - persistence provider implementation
* OntoDriver Sesame - OntoDriver implementation for Sesame-accessed storages
* OntoDriver OWLAPI - OntoDriver implementation for OWLAPI-accessed files
* OWL2Java - generates JOPA entities based on integrity constraints in input ontology (see Example01)

Other modules represent integration tests and various utilities. Jena OntoDriver is planned as future work.
  
## Usage

Examples of usage of JOPA can be found in the `examples` folder and are as follows:

1. Example01 - JOPA with a Sesame in-memory storage, working with object model generated by OWL2Java
2. Example02 - JOPA using OWLAPI-accessed files as storage
3. Example03 - JOPA with a native Sesame storage utilizing its contexts to store and access data in different RDF named graphs
4. Example04 - Full-blown Java web application with Spring, REST services, ReactJS-based UI and JOPA with Sesame native storage
5. Example05 - JOPA utilizing [OWL2Query](https://kbss.felk.cvut.cz/web/portal/owl2query) - a SPARQL-DL query engine for OWLAPI

Each example has its own README file with a more detailed description.

## More Info
